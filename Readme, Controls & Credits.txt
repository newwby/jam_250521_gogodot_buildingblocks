GOAL

The bush will spawn branches over time.
The branches will spawn leaves.
The goal is to spawn as many leaves as possible, as quickly as possible.

To do so you will need to repeatedly reposition the branches and leaves, as the bush and any branches it spawns cannot spawn further branches/leaves (respectively) if their cardinal directions (north/west/south/east) are blocked.
